    Figure 1: <i>Steve Jobs when he was a child</i>
</div>
<p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and
    chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as
    dictating the evolution of modern technology.
</p>
<p>Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew
    up
    with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. Jobs remembers his father as being very
    skilled at working with his hands.</p>

<p>In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California. This area, just south of Palo Alto, California, was becoming a
    center for electronics. Electronics form the basic elements of devices such as radios, televisions, stereos, and
    computers. At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley." This is because a substance called
    silicon is used in the manufacturing of electronic parts.
</p>
<p>
    As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself. He swam competitively, but was not interested in team sports or
    other group activities. He showed an early interest in electronics and gadgetry. He spent a lot of time working in
    the
    garage workshop of a neighbor who worked at Hewlett-Packard, an electronics manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
    Jobs also enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club. There he saw engineers demonstrate new products, and he saw
    his
    first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with
    computers.
</p>
<p>
    While in high school Jobs attended lectures at the Hewlett-Packard plant. On one occasion he boldly asked William
    Hewlett (1931–2001), the president, for some parts he needed to complete a class project. Hewlett was so impressed
    he
    gave Jobs the parts, and offered him a summer internship at Hewlett-Packard.
</p>
<p>
    After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for two years. He dropped
    out
    after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974. In 1975 Jobs joined a group
    known
    as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz named Steve Wozniak (1950–), was trying to build a small
    computer. Jobs became fascinated with the marketing potential of such a computer.

<h2 id="pre-apple"> Pre Apple</h2>
<p>In mid-1973, Jobs moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renting his own apartment. Jobs hitchhiked and
    worked
    around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. Jobs and Brennan remained involved with each
    other
    while continuing to see other people. In 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game
    Pong. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to Atari, Inc. in Los
    Gatos,
    California. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician.Atari's cofounder Nolan
    Bushnell
    later described him as "difficult but valuable", pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in the
    room,
    and he would let people know that : " By early 1974, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a "simple life"
    in a
    Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money for his impending trip to India.
</p>
<p>Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and
    eventual
    Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it
    was
    almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry
    riverbed to
    an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. </p>
<p>After seven months, Jobs left India and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke. Jobs had changed his
    appearance;
    his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing. During this time, Jobs experimented with
    psychedelics,
    later calling his LSD experiences "one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life". He
    spent
    a period at the All One Farm, a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert Friedland. Brennan joined him there
    for a
    period.</p>
<p>Jobs then returned to Atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout.
    According
    to Bushnell, Atari offered US $100 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little
    specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them
    if
    Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, Wozniak reduced the TTL
    count
    to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line. According to Wozniak, Jobs
    told him that Atari gave them only $700 (instead of the $5,000 paid out), and that Wozniak's share was thus
    $350.
    Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it
    and
    explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.</p>
<p>Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the
    development and marketing of the first Apple computer.</p>

<p>
    Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who
    was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer
    logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally
    turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family
    garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 4: <i> Steve Jobs (right) and Stephen Wozniak holding an Apple I circuit board, c.
    1976.</i></p>
<p>Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at
    least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak
    designed an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded
    plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.</p>
<p>
    Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain financing, distribution, and
    publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The
    machine was an immediate success, becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a
    record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the Fortune 500
    list of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be its chief
    executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation. Jobs had
    convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your
    life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer
    revolution.
</p>
<p>During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small
    group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)
    to see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs
    left the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a
    lower-cost computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in
    favouring the Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them
    as artists, but his style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board
    simply because he considered it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be
    not merely great but “insanely great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly
    choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be
    pointed to as the archetype of “event marketing.”</p>
<p>However, the first Macs were underpowered and expensive, and they had few software applications—all of which resulted
    in disappointing sales. Apple steadily improved the machine, so that it eventually became the company’s lifeblood as
    well as the model for all subsequent computer interfaces. But Jobs’s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly
    led to tensions in the company, and in 1985 Sculley convinced Apple’s board of directors to remove the company’s
    famous cofounder.</p>

<h2 id="next-pixar">NeXT And Pixar</h2>
<p>Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation computers for the education market. His
    funding partners included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the
    NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such
    as Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs focused the company on its innovative software system,
    NEXTSTEP.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a computer graphics firm that had been founded as a
    division of Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director George Lucas. Over the following
    decade Jobs built Pixar into a major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first full-length
    feature film to be completely computer-animated, Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made
    Jobs, for the first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the studio to the Disney Company in 2006.</p>

<p>In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of
    Business, where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene "was right there in the front row in
    the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a
    little giddy."After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that
    point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life. Powell's father died when
    she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in.
    After she received her BA from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it
    didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was
    athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did
    and was more of a private than public person. Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with "a fistful of freshly picked
    wildflowers". They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National
    Park. Fifty people, including his father, Paul, and his sister, Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs'
    guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended
    with a hike (during which Laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: "You see,
    Mona [...], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir."</p>
<p>Jobs' and Powell's first child, Reed, was born September 1991. Jobs' father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on
    March 5, 1993. Jobs and Powell had two more children, Erin, born in August 1995, and Eve, born in 1998. The family
    lived in Palo Alto, California. A journalist who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with "the
    scariest [Halloween] decorations in Palo Alto...I don't remember seeing him. I was busy being terrified."</p>

<p>
    In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing
    Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became the factor chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July
    1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September. In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on
    returning to profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the
    coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, "afraid that they
    might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful
    of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company." Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making
    it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.</p>
<p>With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP,
    which evolved into Mac OS X. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction
    of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple.
    At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at Apple and became
    permanent CEO. Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title "iCEO".</p>

<p>The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction
    of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, the company made forays into
    consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the
    introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with
    its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing open-ended innovation, Jobs also
    reminded his employees that "real artists ship".</p>
<p>Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell
    for making "un-innovative beige boxes". On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what he
    would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to
    the shareholders". Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all employees when Apple's market capitalization rose above
    Dell's:

    Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close,
    Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was
    worth a moment of reflection today. Steve. </p>
<p>Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed
    the "reality distortion field" and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as
    "Stevenotes") at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences.</p>
<p>Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.</p>
<p>In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of
    $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10.
    It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and
    that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal
    charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though
    an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these
    issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003. </p>
<p>In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at
    environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple
    announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying
    a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner
    read "Steve, don't be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste."</p>
<p>In 2006, he further expanded Apple's recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. This program includes
    shipping and "environmentally friendly disposal" of their old systems. The success of Apple's unique products and
    services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Apple to become the world's most valuable
    publicly traded company in 2011. </p>

<p>Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at
    the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. He
    summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by
    quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky: There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. "I skate to where the puck
    is going to be, not where it has been." And we've always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very, very beginning.
    And we always will.
    On July 1, 2008, a US$7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple board of directors
    for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud. </p>
<p>In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with US President Barack Obama,
    complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was "headed for a one-term
    presidency". Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should
    automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, "The president is very smart, but he kept
    explaining to us reasons why things can't get done . . . . It infuriates me".</p>

<h2 id="health-issues">Health issues</h2>
<p>In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. He put off surgery for about nine months while he
    tried alternative medicine approaches. In 2004 he underwent a major reconstructive surgery known as the Whipple
    operation. During the procedure, part of the pancreas, a portion of the bile duct, the gallbladder, and the duodenum
    were removed, after which what was left of the pancreas, the bile duct, and the intestine were reconnected to direct
    the gastrointestinal secretions back into the stomach. Following a short recovery, Jobs returned to running
    Apple.</p>
<p>Throughout 2008 Jobs lost significant weight, which produced considerable speculation that his cancer was back. (The
    average survival rate for patients who underwent Whipple operations was only 20 percent at five years.) Perhaps more
    than those of any other large corporation, Apple’s stock market shares were tied to the health of its CEO, which led
    to demands by investors for full disclosure of his health—especially as the first reasons given for his weight loss
    seemed insufficient to explain his sickly appearance. On January 9, 2009, Jobs released a statement that he was
    suffering from a hormonal imbalance for which he was being treated and that he would continue his corporate duties.
    Less than a week later, however, he announced that he was taking an immediate leave of absence through the end of
    June in order to recover his health. Having removed himself, at least temporarily, from the corporate structure,
    Jobs resumed his previous stance that his health was a private matter and refused to disclose any more details.
</p>
<p>In June 2009 the Wall Street Journal reported that Jobs had received a liver transplant the previous April. Not
    disclosed was whether the pancreatic cancer he had been treated for previously had spread to his liver. The
    operation was performed in Tennessee, where the average waiting period for a liver transplant was 48 days, as
    opposed to the national average of 306 days. Jobs came back to work on June 29, 2009, fulfilling his pledge to
    return before the end of June. In January 2011, however, Jobs took another medical leave of absence. In August he
    resigned as CEO but became chairman. He died two months later.</p>
<h2 id="resignation">Resignation</h2>
<p>On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced
    that he had been granted a medical leave of absence. Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his
    decision was made "so he could focus on his health". As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple
    announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major
    strategic decisions at the company. While on leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC
    keynote introducing iCloud on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7.</p>
<p>On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the board, "I have always said if there
    ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let
    you know. Unfortunately, that day has come." Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor
    as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California, home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a
    relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which resulted in respiratory arrest.
    He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. His sister, Mona
    Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.
    Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner,
    Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost
    consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of
    which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public. Jobs is buried in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa
    Memorial Park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in Palo Alto.</p>

<h2 id="apple-1">Apple I</h2>
<p>Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, which led to the
    formation of Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the first Apple I prototypes by
    hand, and sold some of their belongings in order to do so. Eventually, 200 units were produced.</p>

<h2 id="apple-2">Apple II</h2>
<p>The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer
    products, designed primarily by Wozniak (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case and Rod Holt
    developed the unique power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak
    and was the first consumer product sold by Apple.</p>

<h2 id="apple-lisa">Apple Lisa</h2>
<p>The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple during the early 1980s. Itwas the first personal computer to offer
    a graphical user interface in a machineaimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978.
    TheLisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.</p>
<p>In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the Macintoshproject. The Macintosh is not a direct
    descendant of Lisa, although there areobvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10,
    was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.</p>

</div>
<p>Once he joined the original Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic
    airplane accident and temporarily left the company. Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This
    was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. This first
    model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models
    which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the
    Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the
    development of the first model. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television
    commercial, "1984". It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and some
    people consider the ad a "watershed event" and a "masterpiece". Regis McKenna called the ad "more successful than
    the Mac itself". "1984" uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a
    Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the conformity of
    IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four,
    which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother."</p>
<p>The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by
    the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for
    businesses. Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the
    second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.</p>

<h2 id="imac">iMac</h2>
<p>Apple iMac was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple
    boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." Described as "cartoonlike", the
    first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced
    the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the
    all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a
    breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also
    featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for
    connecting peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised
    among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of
    translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).</p>

<h2 id="itunes">iTunes</h2>
<p>iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed
    by Apple. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media
    available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The
    iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.
    Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks,
    podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth
    generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App
    Store.</p>

<h2 id="ipod">iPod</h2>
<p>The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size
    achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the
    first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB. The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold
    before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music
    industry. Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone. After the 1st
    generation of iPod, Apple released the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, the video-capable
    iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.</p>

<p>In 2005, Steve Jobs conceived an idea of using a touchscreen to interact with a computer in a way in which he could
    directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time.
    He decided that the device would require a triple layered capacitive multi-touch touch screen, a very new and
    advanced technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical keyboard and mouse, the same as a tablet
    computer. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project. When Jobs reviewed
    the prototype and its user interface, he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone. The whole
    effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.</p>
<p>The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 in a keynote address at the Macworld Conference &
    Expo held in Moscone West in San Francisco, California. In his address, Jobs said, "This is a day, that I have been
    looking forward to for two and a half years", and that "today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone." Jobs
    introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices: a "widescreen iPod with touch controls"; a "revolutionary
    mobile phone"; and a "breakthrough Internet communicator".</p>

<h2 id="ipad">iPad</h2>
<p>Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech that the company's strategy was simple: "What we want to do is we
    want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20
    minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don't have to hook up to anything and you're
    in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers."</p>
<p>iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple. The first iPad was released on April 3,
    2010; the most recent iPad models, the iPad (2017), iPad Pro, and iPad Mini 4, were released on September 9, 2015,
    and March 24, 2017. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual
    keyboard. The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models. As of April 2015, more than
    250 million iPads have been sold.</p>
